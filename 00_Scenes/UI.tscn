Did some research, and I was right, there aren’t really any animals that live here. Sometimes birds migrate here, but the thing I saw was way too low to the ground to be a bird.

The animals seem okay, but I know sudden intense stress like that can have serious effects on the little guys. I have no idea how to actually check them for that, because Johnny’s manuals really only went over illnesses they might get, not things like stress. I’ll just hope they’ll be fine too.
